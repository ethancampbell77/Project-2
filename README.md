Title: smalltalk

Description: An application for starting conversations with strangers (AKA making small talk). 

How To Use: 

This app requires the user to sign up by creating a profile. After creating an account the user can choose their own descriptive keywords for the person they wish to talk to - upon hitting submit the user will be provided 5 topics in the form of questions as well as the author/source of the information. 

We have plenty of ideas as to how we can scale this app in possible future versions.
